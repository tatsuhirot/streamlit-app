## Projects

- **Fish Catch Viewer**: Analysis and visualization of fish catch data, helping to understand trends in fish populations, catch volumes by species, and the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems.
        
- **CO2 Emission Viewer**: Visualizations related to the operations of ships, including fuel consumption, CO2 emissions. This area aims to provide insights into the efficiency and environmental impact of maritime transport.

The goal of this app is not only to present data in an interactive and informative manner but also to highlight the importance of sustainable practices and effective operations in  shipping and fishing industries.
